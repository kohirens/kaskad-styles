# Kaskād Styles

This is a library of CSS rules for public use. It is meant to serve as a set of
rules that you can apply to your application to aid in making your site neat and
krispy. If you not to into writing your own CSS or you just like a head-start,
then this may be for you. We provide this free-of-charge.

We replace some of the default CSS that comes with browsers, but not all of it.
This is NOT as fancy as other CSS libraries out there, and we do try to use
minimal CSS, taking advantage of new CSS features, to keep down the
bloat and make something impressive; but not to gaudy.

To take full advantage, specific classes are to be applied to specific HTML
layouts. So please be sure to check the docs. We try to keep the docs concise
(TLDR), but please ask questions in the GitHub issues about things that are not
clear.

## About

`kaˈskād` is the phonetic spelling of "cascade". This was just to make the name
unique enough to easily search. Apologies for using the `ā` character, I know
that it may NOT be easy to type in. In most cases you can just use `a` since
a lot of systems may rely on the ASCII character set. For example, notice the
GitHub repository uses a regular `a` that is in the ASCII family.
